##Lawn List 

***As a user, I want to be able to create and add contacts to a contact list. The contact information I would like to store is the first name, last name, address, phone nunmber, address, city, state, and zip-code.

***As a user, I want to be able to make a route for my employees to follow throughout the day. Inside the schedule I would like a check off button so I can indicate to my boss that I have completed that lawn / job.

***As a user, I want to be able to add a notes for the next time to come back or so my boss can read them to see if there was anything he / she could charge for additionally.

***As a user, I would like to see a calendar and drag and drop the lawns / jobs where it fits with the route.

***As a user, I would like to see the weather displayed on the homepage to schedule the lawn / job accordingly.


###Stretch Goals

**Stripe Api** *** so that when a lawn / job is completed, I click the button a invoice is sent to the customer.
